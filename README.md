A Snakemake workflow for analysing CMIP6 model output. This workflow is designed work with CMIP6
model data stored in DKRZ data format. 

## Installation

Before you can run the workflow the a conda environment need to be built first:

```
conda env create -f dustysnake -p ./dustysnake
```
Then activate the environment: 

```
conda activate ./dustysnake

``` 
## Usage

The workflow can be configured in the `config/config.yaml` file. Here which
experiment and activities to analyze can be defined. Current version has been primarily developed for analyzing AerChemMIP type of experiments.  

* Uses the `lookup_*.yaml` files are used to find the  CMIP6 files, to avoid to extensive globbing search. 
  To make it faster when working on mounted file systems. 

* Extending the workflow can be done trough adding additional rules. Following the standard snakemake format.

### Running the workflow:
Default is to run the `all` rule defined in the `Snakefile`:
```
snakemake -j2 
``` 

The `-j` argument specify how many cores the workflow will use. 
  
To print which rules are defined in the workflow use:
```
snakemake -l

To generate the decomposition tables use:
```
snakemake -j2 generate_table
```

## Mounting of CMIP6 storage server
This workflow relies on the having access to the Betzy and Nird storage system. Most of the 
CMIP6 data archived in Norway is stored at the Betzy, while the NorESM output is archived on the 
NIRD server. However it should also be possible to make the workflow work on any storage systems also as the data is archived following the DKRZ data format.
